ESP32 Temperature and Humidity Monitoring Station

Overview
This project utilizes an ESP32 board to create a temperature and humidity monitoring station. The station periodically measures temperature and humidity and displays the readings on a 16x2 LCD screen. It combines two separate Arduino setups into a single one, integrating an LCD screen and a DHT11 sensor.

Features
Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity.
Easy-to-understand visual display on LCD screen.
Adjustable contrast for LCD screen.
Simple setup using readily available components.
Components Used
ESP32 board
DHT11 sensor
16x2 LCD screen
Potentiometer (for contrast adjustment)
Breadboard
Power supply
